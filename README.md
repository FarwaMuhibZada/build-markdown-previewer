### Project Description

This Markdown Previewer is a React-based web application that allows users to input GitHub-flavored Markdown text and see a live preview of the rendered HTML. The application includes a text editor where users can type Markdown and a preview section that updates in real-time to show the corresponding HTML output. It uses the `marked` library to parse the Markdown and render it as HTML. This project meets all specified user stories, including displaying default Markdown content on load and interpreting various Markdown elements such as headings, links, inline code, code blocks, lists, blockquotes, images, and bold text. The user interface is simple and responsive, providing an intuitive experience for exploring Markdown syntax.

## User Stories

1. I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
2. I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
3. When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the `textarea`.
4. When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type.
5. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field contains valid markdown representing various elements (heading, subheading, link, inline code, code block, list item, blockquote, image, and bolded text).
6. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.
